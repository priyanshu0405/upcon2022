  <p>
    Prospective authors are invited to submit full-length original research papers. In submitting a manuscript to CVIP-2020, authors acknowledge that no paper substantially similar in content has been or will be submitted to another journal, conference or workshop during the review period. In such a case the paper will be rejected without review. Papers must be electronically submitted before the deadline expires without exception.<br>
    The paper must not exceed 12 pages in length (including all text, figures, and references).
    The manuscript must be submitted in pdf format only and the file size of your manuscript should not exceed 10 MB.<br>
    Use a proper tool to convert the resulting source into a pdf document that has only scalable fonts with all fonts embedded.<br>
    The images embedded in the paper must not contain transparent pixels (i.e., an alpha-channel of a transparent color) since this could lead to problems when displaying or printing the pdf.<br>
    The pdf manuscript must not have Adobe Document Protection or Document Security enabled.<br><br>
